## Signal

###### BACKGROUND: 
With a strong commitment to the possibilities of decentralized identity coupled with private storage for digital assets like NFT and P2P communications, the elastOS blockchain was the perfect platform to build this dApp upon. elastOS's storage system is called "HIVE" and it's peer-to-peer network the "Carrier Network". 

I wanted to build an application that combined multiple plugins available to elastOS developers and create a solution for trustless-based transactions, identity management and decentralized storage. 

So, I created Signal.

###### DESCRIPTION:

Signal is a decentralized identity and storage application for _x_ built on the elastOS ecosystem.
